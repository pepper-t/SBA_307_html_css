What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

Stuck to my simpler plan. I changed the style to add more bells and whistles.


Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

I am still trying to understand flexbox. I needed more time.
